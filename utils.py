Recently I attended the Super Computing 19 conference where I represented my school as a member of the University of Illinois Student Cluster Competition team; our team won 2nd place nationwide. I've recently also won 2nd place at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications Deep Learning Hackathon. At the Technology Student Associationâ€™s national conference in June, 2019, my team won 1st place out of over 75 teams in a research presentation competition on exploring a novel application of artificial intelligence in a domain field (website: pinkai.tech). I am an enthusiastic candidate for any role relating to HPC or Deep Learning; I hope to expand my skill set in the summer of 2020 through an internship at a company focusing on these disciplines.
